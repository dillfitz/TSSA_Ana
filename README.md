# TSSA_Ana
Note: The transverse single-spin asymmetry (TSSA) analysis library contained within `Asymmetry_Ana/Asymmetry` was initially prepared by Nicole Lewis. More information on components and usage of the library can be found in the README located in that directory.

The images in `workflow_images` describe the programming flow (inputs and outputs of each macro used in the post taxi analysis).
